# BFRB-Gesture-Recognition-Dual-Branch-Deep-Learning-with-Multimodal-Sensors
A Kaggle competition reproduction project for Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRB) detection using wrist-worn multimodal sensor data. The project implements a dual-branch deep learning model to distinguish BFRB gestures (e.g., hair pulling, scratching) from non-BFRB daily actions with high accuracy.
